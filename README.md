# Enrollex
Enrollex is a simple, beginner-friendly 3-tier web application built with Java EE. 
It allows administrators to register students, manage courses, and handle student enrollment using technologies like EJB, JPA, Servlets, and JSP. 
The project follows best practices with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers.
